- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
    writer (added to git HEAD)

- Take further advantage of new template support by moving more and
  more HTML out of Main.hs and into templates (while trying to keep
  the number of templates small)

- Add intermediate type for storing configuration file settings before
  consuming them in mkConfig (right now they're unsafe accesses
  predicated on the requiredValues list)

- Think about how to provide an upgrade path for people who upgrade mb
  to use on preexisting blog data directories.  Set a version in the
  config?
