- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
    writer (added to git HEAD)

- It's a little annoying (and, for some, possibly broken) that the
  colors for LaTeX equations in pages and titles are hardcoded in the
  source (see calls to MB.Gladtex.gladTex)

  - Now this can be put into the config file!

- Make listen mode detect configuration changes

- Try to unify change detection in listen mode with post re-rendering
  determination

- Take further advantage of new template support by moving more and
  more HTML out of Main.hs and into templates (while trying to keep
  the number of templates small)
