  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
    writer (added to git HEAD)

- It's a little annoying (and, for some, possibly broken) that the
  colors for LaTeX equations in pages and titles are hardcoded in the
  source (see calls to MB.Gladtex.gladTex)
