- Command-line program to:

  - generated index.html includes latest N posts only, configurable?

  - need the ability to "preview" posts (possibly for local editing?).
    One idea is to put mb in "listening" mode in which it periodically
    (every second or so) looks to see if any blog posts have been
    created or modified and regenerates content from them.  This would
    be good if you had a local installation and wanted to work on a
    post before pushing it up to your server.  If you develop the post
    on the same machine as the server, this doesn't work as well.

- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
