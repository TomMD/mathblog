- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
    writer (added to git HEAD)

- It's a little annoying (and, for some, possibly broken) that the
  colors for LaTeX equations in pages and titles are hardcoded in the
  source (see calls to MB.Gladtex.gladTex)

  - Now this can be put into the config file!

- Take further advantage of new template support by moving more and
  more HTML out of Main.hs and into templates (while trying to keep
  the number of templates small)

- Add intermediate type for storing configuration file settings before
  consuming them in mkConfig (right now they're unsafe accesses
  predicated on the requiredValues list)
