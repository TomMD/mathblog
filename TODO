- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script (fixed in release 1.2)

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
    writer (added to git HEAD)

- It's a little annoying (and, for some, possibly broken) that the
  colors for LaTeX equations in pages and titles are hardcoded in the
  source (see calls to MB.Gladtex.gladTex)

- Support for embedded gnuplot scripts with configurable preamble, e.g.,

  set samples 500
  set zeroaxis
  set noborder
  set xtics axis nomirror
  set ytics axis nomirror
  set term png
  set output "bar.png" # some temp file name that gets written to an
                       # image in the images directory

  foo(x) = (x <= 1.0 ? x : 1/0)
  bar(x) = (x > 1.0 ? x + 0.5 : 1/0)
  plot [-5.0:5.0] [-5.0:5.0] foo(x) lt rgb "red", bar(x) lt rgb "red" notitle

- Migrate to actual templates to support things like setting per-page
  titles
