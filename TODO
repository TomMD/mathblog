- Directory of markdown text files

- Directory of generated blog content, with an index.html root

- No comment support for now

- Command-line program to:

  - scan text files and see which ones do not have corresponding
    generated content, or which ones need to be re-generated

  - uses the pandoc library directly (not external invocation) to
    generate HTML / gladtex files from markdown source

  - generate index.html or something (should be safe to regenerate
    this. probably we want a preamble and postamble)

  - generated index.html includes latest N posts only, configurable

  - also generates a master post listing, linked from the index.html

  - need the ability to "preview" posts

- Configuration interface:

  - need to know location of "base directory"

  - use environment variable so command line is simple

- Directory structure:

  base/
  base/html/index.html
  base/html/list.html
  base/html/stylesheets/*.css
  base/html/posts/*.html
  base/html/images/*.png
  base/templates/preamble.html
  base/templates/postamble.html
  base/posts/*.txt
