- Directory of markdown text files

- Directory of generated blog content, with an index.html root

- No comment support for now

- Command-line program to:

  - scan text files and see which ones do not have corresponding
    generated content, or which ones need to be re-generated

    done

  - uses the pandoc library directly (not external invocation) to
    generate HTML / gladtex files from markdown source

    done

  - generate index.html or something (should be safe to regenerate
    this. probably we want a preamble and postamble)

  - generated index.html includes latest N posts only, configurable?

  - also generates a master post listing, linked from the index.html

    done

  - need the ability to "preview" posts (possibly for local editing?).
    One idea is to put mb in "listening" mode in which it periodically
    (every second or so) looks to see if any blog posts have been
    created or modified and regenerates content from them.  This would
    be good if you had a local installation and wanted to work on a
    post before pushing it up to your server.  If you develop the post
    on the same machine as the server, this doesn't work as well.

- Configuration interface:

  - need to know location of "base directory"

  - use environment variable so command line is simple

- Directory structure:

  base/
  base/html/index.html
  base/html/list.html
  base/html/stylesheets/*.css
  base/html/posts/*.html
  base/html/images/*.png
  base/templates/preamble.html
  base/templates/postamble.html
  base/posts/*.txt

- Record somewhere what I have done to pandoc and gladtex to make all
  of this work nicely

  - fix environment threading in gladtex script

  - add dpi EQ attribute support in gladtex script

  - differentiate between inline and display math in pandoc HTML
